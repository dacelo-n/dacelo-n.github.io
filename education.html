										<h2 id="content">University of California, Los Angeles</h2>
										<p>I studied Linguistics at UCLA. We focused on the general understanding of human language as opposed to any one specific language. 
										My studies explored Phonetics, Semantics, Phonology, Syntax, and Morphology. AS part of the requirements,two languages needed to be taken : one 
									being any language and the second a non Indo-European language. I took Quechua, spoken by the Incas and still in Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador. As well
								as Zapotec, a language family of dialects spoken in Mexico.</p>
												<h2 id="content">Santa Monica College</h2>
												<p>At SMC I've taken introduction courses in: C++, Java, PHP, Javascript, Assembly, and Visual Basic. I acquired a
												<a href="http://www.smc.edu/StudentServices/TransferServices/AreasofStudy/Documents/Associate_Degrees/computer_science_as.pdf#page=8"> Department Certificate in Entry Level Programmer.</a> The aim of it is to prepare students for an entry level position in software development.
												I continue to take course at a distance via Online Classes with SMC to work towards an Associates Degree in Computer Science to leave my options
												open if I would like to pursue a Masters at any point in the future. The beginning skills that I've learn in a traditional classroom setting have given the tools I needed to continue learning at my own pace and on the areas of Computer Science that interest me.

												<h3>Autodidacticism</h3>
												<p>Simply put, tradtional schooling is great, but if you have the resources ( the internet ) and discipline, you can teach yoursef so much at your own pace, on your free time, and in your home. I've learned so much from following Youtube tutorials, podcasts, tutorial websites, Stack Overflow, Google search, IRC's, blogs, talking with people in the industry and just by trying. We're never done learning and pulling information from different sources I believe, gives a more holistic understanding on the subject matter.</p>
